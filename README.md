# Cumulocity IoT UI KPI Aggregator Widget Plugin

![Screencapture of the widget, demoing a change in config and the loading of a second batch of pages.](./docs/preview.gif)

The KPI aggregator widget allows you to quickly configure and visualize queries againt the inventory API, and count or aggregate single result fragments, on client side (in the browser).

## Features

The widget can be [configured](#widget-config) to query inventory managed objects, based on [the filter query langugage](https://cumulocity.com/api/core/10.18.0/#tag/Query-language), enhanced with [context sensitive query parameters](#context-sensitive-queries).

For visualization, [three display modes](#display-modes) are avilable: a "bar chart" ‚Äì¬†or rather a listing with the percentual value represented as background-color ‚Äì, a pie chart and a table ‚Äì listing all queried assets.

To be able to control the potential pandoras box of queries, options to limit the number of results per request, the number of parallel requests and requests per page are configurable, as well as an option to only run the query on demand.

### Display Modes

Currently, five display modes are available. Functional, both aggregation and counting views share identical configurations and provide two visualisation flavours: üìä bar and üç∞ pie chart.

### Meta Information

### Additional Actions

### Widget Config

#### Context sensitive queries

It is possible to user "context sensitive" parameters within your query. This means that parts of your query can be replaced by values from the managed object of your dashboard context, for example: if you would want to display a list of devices from the same owner ‚Äì that hosts the dashboard ‚Äì you can use the query `owner eq "[owner]"`. `[owner]` will then be replaced by the devices types, so that the actual request would read `owner eq "your.email@host.net"`.

Ht econtext sensitive parameter can also address fragments of objects, such as `[c8y_Hardware.model]` or `[c8y_Availability.status]`. Please note that it is currently not possible to traverse arrays this way.

#### Useful config samples

- Count all devices by type
  - Query: `has(c8y_IsDevice)`
  - Display Mode: `Bar Chart: Count Entries`
  - KPI Fragment: `type`
  - Group by: `type`
  - Sort: `by Value`
  - Order: `Descending`
  - `Show Meta Info` and `Run on Load` checked
- Aggregate critical alarms by device type
  - Query: `has(c8y_IsDevice)`
  - Display Mode: `Pie Chart: Aggregate Entries`
  - KPI Fragment: `c8y_ActiveAlarmsStatus.major`
  - Group by: `type`
  - Label: `type`
  - Sort: `by Value`
  - Order: `Descending`
  - `Show Percent` and `Run on Load` checked

## Installation and update

_TBD: widget installation and update. link?_

---

## Local Development

### Recommended version

- node v 16.x
- npm v 9.x

### Plugin versions

- Angular v 14.x
- WebSDK v 1018.0.x

### How to start

Change the target tenant and application you want to run this plugin on in the `package.json`.

```bash
c8ycli server -u https://{{your-tenant}}.cumulocity.com/ --shell {{cockpit}}
```

Keep in mind that this plugin needs to have an app (e.g. cockpit) running with at least the same version as this plugin. if your tenant contains an older version, use the c8ycli to create a cockpit clone running with **at least version 1016.0.59**! Upload this clone to the target tenant (e.g. cockpit-1016) and reference this name in the `--shell` command.

The widget plugin can be locally tested via the start script:

```bash
npm start
```

In the Module Federation terminology, `widget` plugin is called `remote` and the `cockpit` is called `shell`. Modules provided by this `widget` will be loaded by the `cockpit` application at the runtime. This plugin provides a basic custom widget that can be accessed through the `Add widget` menu.

> Note that the `--shell` flag creates a proxy to the cockpit application and provides `KpiAggregatorWidgetPluginModule` as an `remote` via URL options.

Also deploying needs no special handling and can be simply done via `npm run deploy`. As soon as the application has exports it will be uploaded as a plugin.
